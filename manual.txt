Super Legend of Spyro
Game Manual
Developers: Nick Aiello, Mitch Troy, Greg Nemecek, Nathan Kowaleski

About the Game:
This game was created for our semester project for Prof. Scott Emrich's
Fundamentals of Computing II Class at the University of Notre Dame (Spring
2015)
The game is a 2-D side-scrolling platform game, in which the player tries to
go all the way around the map to reach the finish without accumulating too
much damage from the enemies.  The user can play as Mario, Link, and Spyro,
which each have unique abilities.

Compiler Instructions:
We used the managed make system of Eclipse to compile our code.
To compile from scratch, use:
g++ *.cpp -O0 -g3 -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2main -std=c++11 -static-libstdc++ -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -o fc2proj
The executable can then be run as: 
./fc2proj

Controls:
A, D - Move Left, Right
W - Jump (hold to glide with Spyro)
S - Fall through floating platforms
1, 2, 3 - Switch between Mario, Link and Spyro
F - Ranged attack (Mario, Link only)
V - Melee attack (Link, Spyro only)
The goal is to move around the map to reach the end of the level.  There are
four levels that need to be completed.  The player should avoid being hit by
the enemies and their attacks.  To counter, the player can jump on the enemy
or use the ranged and melee attacks.  Most platforms are solid, but some are
one-way platforms which allow the player to go up and down through it.  The
end of the level is reached when the player arrives at the treasure chest.

Known Bugs:
Spyro's flying ability is a little bit glitchy and can sometimes accidentally
leave the screen.
Our game is unreasonably hard.  This is not really a bug, but something we
would look to improve in the future by decreasing the number of enemies on the
map.

Additional Information:
There is a game controller that we have that works with the game as well. It 
plugs into the computer via a USB port.  Its controls are:
Left, Right (on D-pad) - Move Left, Right
Up (on D-pad) - Jump (hold to glide with Spyro)
Down (on D-pad) - Fall through floating platforms
5, 6, 7 - Switch between Mario, Link and Spyro
2 - Ranged attack (Mario, Link only)
3 - Melee attack (Link, Spyro only)
